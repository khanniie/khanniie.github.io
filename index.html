    <h3> Mock ups! </h3>
    <ol>
    <br><br>
    <li> Mock up one: On hover, thought clouds with her favorite things show up. On click, it will play a gif of her crawling out of the box and striking a <i>very</i> cool pose.

    <li> Mock up two: On hover, thought clouds with her favoite things fly (or fade?) in and bounce around in place a bit. On click, the box turns into a window with her waving at you. <b>We chose the cloud idea for the hover!</b>

    <li> Mock up three: On hover, her favorite things flood the box. On click, a pokemon trainer card for her pops up! <b>She liked the idea of the click, so I am doing the pokemon card popup. </b>

    <h3> Rough Drafts for the Clouds </h3>
       <p> <i> clouds should appear on hover. Anushri likes Suho, cats (hers is named Collar), and korean food! The clouds will be refined to look prettier later hopefully. </i></p>

    <!-- ONE COOL THING HOMEWORK -->

    <h2 id="cooldigital">Assignment: Cool Digital Item that inspires me <br>
    Graphing Caluculator Applications (Specifically on the Texas Instrument calculators)
    </h2>
      
    <p> The TI-84/83/inspire (Color and non-color) Graphing calucators, by Texas instruments are highly popular for high school math classes. But beyond being able to perform complex math functions, they are extremely customizable, allowing the user run premade applications/programs or to program their own calculator programs.</p>
    <p> Programs or applications can be downloaded through a link cable attached to another calculator or a computer.
    With this technology availible, many people have created amazing applications, from hangman to a replication of the entire Pokemon Red/Blue games! There are even ways to make your calcuator run faster or expand its memory space. </p>
      <p> More info can be found at <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/index.php"> this website! </a></p>
        
    <h3>Applications: </h3>
      <ol>
      <li> Doors: This is an application that calls itself the "ultimate shell and GUI". It allows you to run any program or game (written in TI-BASIC or ASM) that you download or create. It also includes other functions such as rename/copy/delete/etc. It's popular, with around 150,000 downloads (for the TI-83 and TI-84 versions)!
      <br>

      </li>
      <li> Games: There are games such as Pokemon, Super Mario, Tetris, Minesweeper, etc. They use emulators to convert the instructions for Gameboys to instructions for the calcuator to execute.

      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/stats.html"> more applications! </a></li>
      </ol>
          
    <h3>Programs: </h3>
      <p>These are much simpler than applications; they can be written within the calcuator using the PRGM button. They're handy for small tasks such as conversions or complex, repetitive computations. They also include a recall picture function, so you can add small pictures into it!</p>
      
      
      
    <p> I have had experience with writing programs on my TI-84, and it's been lots of fun! It's very basic and frustrating at times (no undo button) but also very helpful if you need to use an simple equation over and over. My Calculus class, after APs this year, had a calcuator unit. Some people made projectile motion calcuators, tip calcuators, temperature convertors, mad libs, and games! My group made a "Pocket Korshavn" (the teacher's name was Mr. Korshavn) who would give advice and randomized calculus problems.
    <br> With applications, I recieved a few from a friend a few years ago via link cable, but lost them when I had to reset my calculator. But for a while, I had Doors CSE and Pokemon Red! When I recieved Doors, it came with Tetris and many other games, but the cool thing was that the high scores from my friend were saved and tramsitted to me as well. It blew my mind that I could play Pokemon and Tetris on my calcuator! I was a mosnter at calcuator tetris and set a high score that no one could beat. The pokemon application messed up my calcuator pretty badly, so I had to reset it. But even so, it was amazing how well put together the game was. I can't imagine all the time and effort it must have taken.
