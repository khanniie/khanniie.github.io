## Carnegie Mellon

I was a student at CMU from 2017 - 2021. During that time...

- I was a teaching assistant for 15-122 (Principles of Imperative Computation), 60-210 (Introduction to Interactivity and Computation) and 15-104 (Introduction to Computing for Creative Practice).
- I worked part time as a research assistant for the Studio for Creative Inquiry, where I provided programming assistance on various open source art projects such as these [AR templates](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/ARKit-Educational-Templates).
- I also worked part time as a game developer and research assistant for [Oh!Lab](http://theohlab.org/) led by Jessica Hammer, where I co-published [a paper on chatbots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376708).
