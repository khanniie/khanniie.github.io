## p5.js editor

P5.js is a popular Javascript library for creative coding. The [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) is an online tool for creating p5.js sketches without needing to download or configure anything.

As a student apprentice to [Cassie Tarakajian](https://cassietarakajian.com/) in 2021, I contributed to the p5.js editor by researching potential testing methods for the codebase, writing a few example tests, and then writing documentation to standardize the testing practices that we wanted to enforce. I joined during a turning point in the development where the codebase had grown to the point of needing tests so that future contributors of the open-source project could contribute with confidence. There had been some tests already but without any consistency in testing methods, naming, or enforcement.

After writing a few tests, I pivoted to [putting together documentation](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/contributor_docs/testing.md) that could serve as the guide for future contributors.
