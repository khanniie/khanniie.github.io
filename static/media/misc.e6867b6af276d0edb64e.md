## Other things I have made:

- A [dataset of Sephora reviews](https://github.com/everestpipkin/datagardens/tree/master/students/khanniie/5_newDataSet) that mention tears, crying or sobbing that ended up on [Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/sephora-crying-reviews-data-set) and [FlowingData](https://flowingdata.com/2019/11/07/sephora-dataset-is-a-collection-of-makeup-reviews-that-mention-crying/).
- A Cooking Mama game inspired steak made with Unity and Arduino in 2018. I made felt fabric controllers shaped like food and put sensors in them and the subsequent tweet received over half a million views [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/crabbage_/status/1072711212016828416)...
- In collaboration with Swan Carpenter and Alice Chan, a fashion line of [eight light-art wearables](https://vimeo.com/user94463098), made for Lunar Gala, one of Pittsburgh's largest fashion shows.
