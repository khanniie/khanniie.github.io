## algorat art collective

Algorat is a rat-centric computational arts collective. We created the Ratchelor, a [Tiktok-viral](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ratchelor?lang=en) dating game triology with over a million players and over 1.9 million pageviews.

We are made up of [Char Stiles](http://charstiles.com/), Connie Ye, [Tatyana Mustakos](https://tademu.com/), and [Caroline Hermans](https://caro.io/). We were founded at [the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/project/algorat-collective) in Pittsburgh, PA in 2019.

Although we've made all types of minigames, including [a rat avatar generator](https://algorat.club/sharpiemaker/) and a [3D rat sweater maker](https://algorat.club/sweater/index.html), our most popular game (by far!) was [the Ratchelor dating sim triology](https://algorat.club/ratchelor/). The Ratchelor (based on the Bachelor) is a short interactive story where your character searches for love.
