I am Connie! I make mini games and doodle. I live in San Francisco with my 60% chihuahua dog.

When I wake up on the weekdays, I put on my tie and go to my job at Google as a user experience engineer. When I wake up on the weekends, who knows :-)

In 2021, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with university honors and a Bachelors of Computer Science and Art with a secondary major in HCI.

I love to chat! I can be reached at **constance.connie.ye (at) gmail (dot) com**.
