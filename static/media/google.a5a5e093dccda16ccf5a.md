## Google

I've worked at Google since 2021. I'm currently on Brand Studio, where I'm a frontend engineer on a team that makes interactive websites for brand campaigns, my favorite of which was the [Most Searched Playground Google Doodle](https://searchplayground.google/) that we launched to celebrate Google's 25th anniversary. We had 24.3 million users and 123 years of culmulative engagement time!!
