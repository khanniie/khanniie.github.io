It's a chrome extension that uses computer vision to auto-generate missing alt tags for images, hide sensitive content, etc.</p>\n<p>Oink won the Google Accessibility Award at TartanHacks! Oink is a Chrome extension with a suite of web accessibility tools. It uses computer vision to auto-generate missing alt tags for images, hides sensitive content, makes font sizes bigger, and alerts users when sound is\nplaying on a webpage. All of these functionalities are included, but can be toggled on and off based on user needs.\nFor this project, I worked in a team of 4, with Kearnie Lin, Megan Ung and Kimberly Lo. I designed and built the UI; I also set up the socket.io backend that's being used to perform the calls to Google Cloud Vision.</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink1.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink2.png\"/></div>\n</div>\n<em>left: popup menu in chrome, right: our icon in the toolbar</em>\n<p><img src=\"../images/oink/oink6.png\" alt=\"image of interface\"><em>image of interface</em></p>\n<h2>Adding in missing alt tags</h2>\n<p>Alt tags are important components of images on the internet for those who use screenreaders to browse the web. However, websites sometimes don't include alt tags for these images, leaving the screenreader-reliant user unable to\nknow what the content of the image is. We realized that we could use modern computer vision techniques to remedy this; our chrome extension looks for images that are missing alt tags, and sends those images\nto our backend through socket.io, which then sends the image through Google Cloud's computer vision to be labeled. We then add in these content labels as alt tags. This socket.io backend was being run continuously on my\nDigital Ocean server.\nBelow is a webpage without our extension. It doesn't have alt tags on its images. With our extension turned on, alt tags have been applied to the image!</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink8.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink7.png\"/></div>\n</div>\n<h2>Sensitive Content Filter</h2>\n<p>Using the same techniques as described above, we can determine what the content of an image is. The web can be difficult for those who are especially sensitive to certain content,\nso we allow the user to give us a list of tags to watch for. We will then hide images that match those tags.</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink6.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/oink/oink5.png\"/></div>\n</div>\n<h2>More!</h2>\n<p>Our app can also increase font size, make links more visible, and alert you if there's sound playing on a page.</p>\n<h2>Future Goals</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../images/oink/oink-future.png\" alt=\"future goals\"><em>future goals</em></p>\n<h2>At the Hackathon!</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../images/oink/tartanhacks-prog.jpg\" alt=\"presenting\"><em>Our team presenting our project!</em></p>\n<div class=\"br-medium\"></div>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Pixel Art TSNE and DCGAN</h1>\n<p class=\"date\">Fall 2018</p>\n<p><strong>I datascraped ~5000 pixel icons from Deviantart and then extracted feature vectors from them, which were used to put them into a grid of nearest neighbors. I also used DCGAN to generate new pixel icons.</strong></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>With this project, I wanted to computationally analyze and recreate Deviantart art because I had been a very active member of Deviantart in my middle school days and\nthought that it would be a nice tribute to those days. I choose pixel icons specifically because of their uniform style and nostalgic value (for me, at least). Because a lot of the work was a little computationally heavy, I remotely ran most of\nmy code on a computer hosted in CMU's Studio for Creative Inquiry. I had been reading a good amount of papers about machine learning and wanted to really play around with topics related to what I had been reading about. I created this project during the first third of my independent study class.</p>\n<h2>Scraping for Images</h2>\n<p>I used Node.js to grab roughly 5000 images using the Deviantart API, querying for square pixel images with a certain amount of likes that had been marked by their creator as \"downloadable.\"\n<img src=\"../images/pixel/devpix.gif\" alt=\"deviantart pixel\"></p>\n<h2>Feature extraction and Tsne</h2>\n<p>In a Jupyter Notebook, I used Pytorch's pretrained VGG16 model to extract feature vectors from all of my images. This allowed me to get the\n\"nearest neighbors\" of any given pixel icon. Shown below are examples of the nearest neighbor finding. The top/larger image was the origin image and the\nfive images below are its nearest neighbors.</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/neighbor1.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/neighbor2.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/neighbor3.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/neighbor4.png\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/neighbor5.png\"/></div>\n</div>\n<p>Then, I could use run tsne on these images to plot them by feature vector. I also used\nan updated (Python 3) implementation of Raster Fairy to turn the 2D point cloud into a grid. Below is the result on a smaller (2000 images) subset of pixels.\n<img src=\"../images/pixel/2000_set_grey.png\" alt=\"tsne\"></p>\n<h2>DCGAN</h2>\n<p>I used an implementation of DCGAN that I found <a href=\"https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN\">here</a> to generate more.\nThey turned out looking a little like pixel mush, so I tried messing around with the learning rate / number of epochs. The results still weren't as good as I was hoping,\nbut I learned a lot about GANs and machine learning during this whole process and am really happy that I did this project.</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/dcgan1.gif\" alt=\"dcgan res 1\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/dcgan2.gif\" alt=\"dcgan res 2\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/dcgan-big.gif\"/></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/60800.png\" alt=\"dcgan res 1\"/></div>\n    <div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/pixel/combined-dcgan.jpg\" alt=\"dcgan res 2\"/></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"br-medium\"></div>\n<hr/>\n<h1>HackMIT: ResQ</h1>\n<p class=\"date\">Fall 2018</p>\n<p>Won HackMIT IBM sponsor award.

These bases will be stored and can be sent to the users’ friends through a friend code. These friends also have the ability to see and modify the same structure if they are within proximity of the same image.\nI created this project to explore the idea of digital intimacy and friendship; I was interested in internet-based relationship dynamics and wanted to prototype a way to share a personal space digitally.\nAll the furniture was textured with hand-painted watercolor textures, and the “sharing” aspect uses both Firebase authorization for user sign in and Firebase’s database to remember base information. The AR was made using vuforia’s cloud database and extended tracking.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/secretbase/secretbase.jpg\" alt=\"image\"><em>furniture in Unity environment</em></p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n    <div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/secretbase/ar-secret-base.gif\"></div>\n    <img class=\"flex-item\" src=\"../images/secretbase/sb-collab.gif\">\n</div>\n<em>left: AR tree and tables, right: treehouse shared with friend&apos;s phone, both can view and edit the same structure</em>\n<div class=\"br-medium\"></div>\n<h2>The Process</h2>\n<p>I started with concept artwork. With AR secret bases, the bases are located forever where their \"image target\" exists and are\nonly accessible to those who have been invited, kind of like a secret treehouse club.\n<img src=\"../images/secretbase/arbase-concept.jpg\" alt=\"concept art\">\nI began by working on integrating Firebase user auth and database into Unity. </p>\n<p>I then started building the Unity environment, which I wanted to use my own textures for. I had considered using premade assets, but wanted\nmy final result to have a more distinctive look. I watercolored my textures in my sketchbook, scanned them in, made a bump map using photoshop and then textured the objects.</p>\n<p>For the basic grid and block placing implementation, the blocks had to snap to the grid and be able to be stacked upon each other. Furthermore, I wanted to have a square\nthat would indicate where the next block would be placed down if the user would press \"place.\"</p>\n<div class=\"fill-row\">\n<div class=\"flex-item-start\"><img src=\"../images/secretbase/firebase.png\"/></div>\n<div class=\"flex-item\"><img src=\"../images/secretbase/brick-demo.gif\"/></div>\n</div>\n<p>I then integrated the block system into the AR part. For each image target I loaded into Vuforia, I gave it a unique id that would later be used to map the image target to them\nfurniture data stored in Firebase.</p>\n<p>Then, I worked on getting the firebase details correct. I was able to send and retrieve data, and authorize users, but I didn’t have a structured way of implementing my idea yet.</p>\n<p>Overall, this was a hard and time-consuming project for me, but I learned a lot about Unity, AR and Firebase in the process.</p>\n<p>Although it could be cleaned up a lot, I was really happy with how it turned out and was happily surprised by how functional it was.</p>\n<p>Thank you to: Nitesh for helping me document, Rain for being the best 15-251 partner, Sophia C. for being a Very Good Buddy, Golan Levin for providing wonderful advice, and Claire for her advice on the watercolor textures!</p>\n<div class=\"br-medium\"></div>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Weekly deliverables</h1>\n<p class=\"date\">Spring 2018</p>\n<p><strong>For the first half of Golan Levin's Spring 2018 Interactivity and Computation course, we produced weekly deliverables.</strong></p>\n<h2>Aesemic Writing (maze writing)</h2>\n<p>For this assignment, I imagined an alien civilization that spoke in riddles and wrote in mazes.
