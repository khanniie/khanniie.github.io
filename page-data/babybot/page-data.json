In this paper we present results from a three week test of a social chatbot in an established online community. During this study, the chatbot \"grew up\" from \"birth\" through its teenage years, engaging with community members and \"learning\" vocabulary from their conversations. We discuss the design of this chatbot, how users' interactions with it evolved over the course of the study, and how it impacted the community as a whole. We discuss how we addressed challenges in developing a chatbot whose vocabulary could be shaped by users, and conclude with implications for the role of machine learning in social interactions in online communities and potential future directions for design of community-based chatbots.\"</p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"Concept As a research assistant in Oh!Lab at Carnegie Mellon, I collaborated with Joseph Seering and Michal Luria to design and program a…"}},"pageContext":{"type":"posts","next":{"id":"b137c10c-c88c-5886-81f1-c54d8278992c","children":[],"parent":"6eb1fc43-2c27-5914-8631-5c5b1607e9b3","internal":{"content":"\nA collaboration with Alice Fang and Sebastian Carpenter.\n\nZoöid is an exploration of light and color as a means for communication in a starless world.
