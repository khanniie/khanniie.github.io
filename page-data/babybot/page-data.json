The chatbot used in this study was developed using Javascript and run locally using Node.js. Package management was handled through npm. We are using several javascript libraries for Twitch relaying, data saving and language generation; notably, we are using tmi.js (v1.4.2) to access Twitch’s Internet Relay Chat, and Rita.js (v1.3.89) to perform natural language processing on our text. </p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/babybot/babybot_flow.png\" alt=\"implementation\"></p>\n<h1>For more information about the implementation, study and final insights, please see our paper.</h1>\n<h1><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376708\">Link to paper</a></h1>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"While the majority of research in chatbot design has focused on creating chatbots that engage with users one-on-one, less work has focused on the design of conversational agents for online communities. In this paper we present results from a three week test of a social chatbot in an established online community. During this study, the chatbot \"grew up\" from \"birth\" through its teenage years, engaging with community members and \"learning\" vocabulary from their conversations. We discuss the design of this chatbot, how users' interactions with it evolved over the course of the study, and how it impacted the community as a whole. We discuss how we addressed challenges in developing a chatbot whose vocabulary could be shaped by users, and conclude with implications for the role of machine learning in social interactions in online communities and potential future directions for design of community-based chatbots.\"</p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"Concept As a research assistant in Oh!Lab at Carnegie Mellon, I collaborated with Joseph Seering and Michal Luria to design and program a…"}},"pageContext":{"type":"posts","next":{"id":"385ae959-16b7-52ff-aa9f-8d3c6622fb96","children":[],"parent":"1ae790ce-de72-5d23-a990-8fda4b28f631","internal":{"content":"\n# About\nA Unity and Arduino version of popular game Cooking Mama!
