I joined during a turning point in the development where the codebase had grown to the point of needing tests so that future contributors of the open-source project could contribute with confidence. There had been some tests already but without any consistency in testing methods, naming, or enforcement.</p>\n<p class=\"para\">I researched different testing methods and philosophies, file structure setups, naming conventions, and more. After writing a few tests, I pivoted to putting together documentation that could serve as the guide for future contributors.</p>\n<p class=\"para\">I learned a lot during this project and had a blast learning about Javascript testing.
