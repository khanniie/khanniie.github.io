I made two felt fabric controllers (one spam, one steak) shaped like food and put sensors in them.\nWhen I first learned how to use an Arduino, one of my first instincts was to connect it with Unity. At first, I had trouble coming up with an idea for a unity + arduino experience\nthat would leverage the advantages of both. Ultimately, I was inspired by Cooking Mama, a game that I had loved in my childhood. I was excited by\nthe idea of enhancing the game experience with a physical controller. How will a felt knife and a felt steak compare to a Nintendo stylus? Will it make it more fun? Will it be the same?\nI love the idea of making alternative experiences, and this was a way of exploring that.\nThank you to Sidney Church for helping me connect the Arduino to unity and for all of the Arduino help!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/meat-salad.gif\" alt=\"example gif 1\">\n<img src=\"../images/meat-salad.jpg\" alt=\"example img\"></p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2O5I6Tr3ms\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h1>Documentation pictures &#x26; Code</h1>\n<p>The look of the felt fabric food controllers was inspired by Lucy Sparrow's Sparrow Mart, a supermarket made up of food made from felt.\nYou can find the code <a href=\"https://github.com/khanniie/unity-arduino-cooking-mama\">here</a>.\nThe steak controller contains six buttons attached to a breadboard. On top of the buttons, I laid flat acrylic boards that I cut into sections so that the buttons could have a greater\nrange of influence. The spam contains a photocell that can tell when you remove the meat, and the bowl also contains a photocell to detect when the meat is placed inside.\nFor the unity part, I am sending the information from the Arduino to serial port, which unity then reads from.\n<img src=\"../images/meat-salad-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"diagram of work\">\n<img src=\"../images/meat-salad-documentation.jpg\" alt=\"diagram of work\">\n<em>left: the felt steak and fabric parts, right: developing with arduino</em></p>","excerpt":"About A Unity and Arduino version of popular game Cooking Mama!
