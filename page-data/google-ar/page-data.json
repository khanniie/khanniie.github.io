Although the nature of the project is still confidential, I can still talk generally about some of the skills that I used and the lessons that I learned. If you'd like to learn more, please reach out :-). If you're a Google employee, contact me.</p>\n<p class=\"para\">Towards the end of my summer internship, my team extended my internship through a small program at Google that allows interns to continue working part-time while in university. So during the Fall semester of my senior year, I worked part-time (20% for a month, and then 50% for two months). </p>\n<p class=\"para\">This was my first time working in a product-focused team. As part of the UX team, I worked closely with other UXers, but also interacted with PMs and software engineers to help investigate UX and research questions. </p>\n<h1>Technologies / skills</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Android app development with Android Studio</li>\n<li>Android/iOS app development with Unity and AR Foundation</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Vision API integration</li>\n<li>Web development </li>\n<li>3D modeling with Autodesk Maya</li>\n<li>Demo and concept video editing with Adobe suite</li>\n<li>Illustration under the direction of a creative director for internal projects</li>\n<li>Human-centered design thinking</li>\n<li>Prototyping and iteration</li>\n<li>System and Input UX design</li>\n<li>OpenCV</li>\n<li>Stats and research</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"para\"><img src=\"../images/google-ar/WFH.jpg\" alt=\"work from home\">\n<em>My desk while I worked from home!</em></p>\n<p class=\"para\">Thank you to my intern host Shiblee, who taught me so much about hardware UX, augmented reality, and more.
