I also worked on the development of the design with the designer and contributed to the interaction design of the prototype.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://learn-variable-fonts.web.app/#/intro\">Live website</a></h2>\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Weeks 1 - 2: Orientation, familiarizing with the tech, design</li>\n<li>Weeks 3 - 5: Building prototype</li>\n<li>Weeks 6 - 8: Iterating and polishing prototype</li>\n<li>Week 9: Prep for user study</li>\n<li>Week 10 - 11: User studies running, making last-minute changes to suit the study</li>\n<li>Week 12: Wrap up, presentations, and study findings</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"para\"><img src=\"../images/google-material/page1.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\">\nFirst, the user will see an example of an axis in isolation, such as the grade axis. The example will be shown with a description of what the axis can do. The user can then play around with the slider and the CSS.\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/google1.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\">\nWe provide the CSS for developers and designers so they can understand how to implement variable fonts and how the axis values are implemented.\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/google2.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\">\nThen, we move on to an example of how that axis might be used in a design context.\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/page5.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\">\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/page7.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\">\nWe finish the experience with a sandbox where users are given freedom to fiddle with all of the axes at once. They can then see how this changes the typographic scale and the text in the UI. Hovering over text elements in the UI also highlights which type drawer to use to modify it.\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/google3.gif\" alt=\"images of primary project\"></p>\n<h1>Secondary Project</h1>\n<p class=\"para\">For my secondary project, I created a microsite with interactive creative demos for variable fonts.\nI was given an incredible amount of agency for this project. The visual design and concepts are my own,\naided by the feedback by the many amazing designers on the Material Design team.\nThe site is currently live at <a href=\"googlefonts.github.io/fluid\">googlefonts.github.io/fluid</a>.\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/second1.gif\" alt=\"images of secondary project\">\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/second2.gif\" alt=\"images of secondary project\">\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/second3.gif\" alt=\"images of secondary project\">\n<img src=\"../images/google-material/second4.gif\" alt=\"images of secondary project\"></p>\n<p class=\"para\">Special thanks to my intern host from that summer, Brenton, who been an amazing mentor and has taught me so much about the web and UX prototyping. Also huge thanks to Michelle and Clay for co-hosting, Paula for her help with UX writing, and Dave and Lenny for their help from the Google Fonts side.</p>","excerpt":"Primary Project My intern project involved working in a team with a designer and a researcher to create a prototype that we used in a userâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"type":"posts","next":{"id":"3d8b1d1f-bc63-52ac-9b1d-6d5495cef785","children":[],"parent":"308b7361-1bfb-5635-8680-19f15bde6f59","internal":{"content":"\n# Project\n\nIn Summer and Fall 2020, I was a UX Engineering intern on Google's AR team (formerly known as Daydream).
