# README

1. Make sure you've successfully 💯 followed the directions [here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/1c2911b7a6c2dfecd463823e6253a96d) to set up your Arduino.
2. `cd` into the directory 📁 holding the files in this repository and run `npm install`, this looks at the `package.json` file here and ⬇ installs [`express`](http://expressjs.com/) and [`johnny-five`](http://johnny-five.io/), two libraries we use in this example.
3. Connect your sensor to pin `A0` on the Arduino.
4. Run `node arduino.js` to load the `arduino.js` file onto the Arduino.
5. Open `input-to-background-color.html` and see if the background color changes as you expect!
